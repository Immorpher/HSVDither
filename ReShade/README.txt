About HSV Dither 1.0
----------------------------------------------
HSV Dither is a non-linear color boosting, banding and dithering shader. It leaves the hues untouched for good color reproduction while optionally boosting and dithering brightness and saturation.


Installation and Use
----------------------------------------------
To use the shader first install ReShade onto your game/software of choice. Then in the "\reshade-shaders\Shaders\" directory of the program, add the "HSVDither.fx" file. When you load your program, ReShade should also load which will give you instructions on how to set it up. HSVDither.fx will now be one of the options. When selected you will find the following options:

"Brightness Boost" is a non-linear brightness boost by boosting the V value of HSV.
"Saturation Boost" is a non-linear saturation boost by boosting the S value of HSV.
"Banding Curve" is the ammount to non-linearly skew brightness banding. Higher numbers have smoother darks and band brights more, which is good for dark games.
"Brightness Levels" is the number of brightness levels. The lower the number, the more more bands and less brightness levels. 
"Brightness Dither" is the type of brightness dither to use: 0 for Bayer 2x2, 1 for Bayer 8x8, 2 for static noise, 3 for motion noise, 4 for scanline, 5 for checker, 6 for magic square, 7 for grid dithering, and 8 for none.
"Saturation Levels" is the number of saturation levels. The lower the number, the more more bands and less colors used. 
"Saturation Dither" is the type of saturation dither to use: 0 for Bayer 2x2, 1 for Bayer 8x8, 2 for static noise, 3 for motion noise, 4 for scanline, 5 for checker, 6 for magic square, 7 for grid dithering, and 8 for none.
"Dither Scale" is the pixel size of the dither. This can be done in combination with an in-engine pixel size setting.
